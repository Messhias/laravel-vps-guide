# The VPS Guide for Laravel 4

After a year of creating Laravel projects, I have found that there is a shortage on how to configure Servers for your Applications.

Though, there are guides spread all over the internet on setting up PHP servers, this guide looks to be an easy to follow single source for installing everything you need to get started with a lean production server for Laravel 4 (and any PHP Composer project you may want to run).

This repository looks to have configuration guides for multiple OS from start to deploy. If you would like to contribute to the project, open an issue or pull request.

## Available Guides

-	Ubuntu 12.04
	-	[ ] Apache2
